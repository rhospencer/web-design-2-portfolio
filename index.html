            <p>
              My name is Spencer Rhoton and I am a Full Stack Web Developer
              based out of St. George, Utah. My passion for coding developed
              during my time at DevMountain, a coding boot camp located in Lehi,
              Utah. I have built several projects using React, Express,
              PostgreSql and other tools. I look forward to continuing my
              knowledge and learning new tools and technologies. During my free
              time I love to ski, run marathons, and spend time with my wife and
              puppy. Feel free to contact me through my contact page. Thanks for
              checking out my portfolio site!

                I created this project to help runners find routes based on
                location and distance and incorporate those routes in their
                training plan.
              </li>
              <li>
                Anyone can visit the site and search for routes based on city
                and distance.

                Registered users and add their own routes as well as add routes
                other users have created into their personal collection of
                routes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Users can create a weekly training plan and attach routes from
                their collection to specific days.

                This group project was created to allow users to play the
                classic board game battleship in a 'play anytime' turn style.
              </li>
              <li>
                Users can add and play against users taking turns to attack
                enemy ships.
              </li>
              <li>
                The game will update and retrieve board data from a MongoDB
                database so users are not forced to play the game in one
                sitting.
              </li>

                My contributions include building endpoints and methods in a
                NodeJS and Express backend, creatingPostgreSQL and MongoDB
                databases, and configured game logic using JavaScript.
